          <p>Welcome to my portfolio page!<br>
           I am a software engineer/web developer that is seeking great opportunities to help innovate and shape our society in a positive way through code.<br>
           I'm based out of Brooklyn, NY and in addition to talking tech I love talking sports.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I studied at The George Washington University and received a BA in Political Science. I worked in the legal industry for 3 years before deciding I wanted to shift my career into programming. I made the decision to enroll at the Flatiron School and that was the best decision I could have made for myself. A fantastic curriculum, a supportive community, and a real eye-opening experience that confirmed that I can make it in this crazy tech world.</p>
